# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

This project aims to detect credit card fraud using machine learning algorithms implemented in R programming. The project utilizes the Card Transactions dataset to classify transactions into fraudulent and genuine categories.

## Key Features

- **Algorithm Implementation:** Implemented Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks, and Gradient Boosting classifiers for credit card fraud detection.
- **Dataset:** Utilized the Card Transactions dataset to train and evaluate the performance of the machine learning models.
- **Accuracy:** Achieved a remarkable 92% accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the applied algorithms.
- **Performance Curves:** Integrated ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) and Precision-Recall curves to provide a comprehensive visual assessment of model performance.
- **Imbalanced Data Handling:** Identified and addressed imbalances in the dataset to enhance the models' accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions.
- **Cybersecurity Impact:** Contributed to improved cybersecurity by developing a robust credit card fraud detection system, offering actionable insights for risk mitigation.
